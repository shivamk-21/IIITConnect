### 1. Introduction

**IIIT Connect** is an Android-based application (which can also be made cross-platform using React Native) designed for college resource management. The app includes three key features:
- **Question Bank**
- **Self-Attendance Tracker**
- **Contacts Directory**

---

### 2. Proposed System

#### Question Bank:
- Users (students) can perform two main tasks: **Paper Viewing** and **Paper Upload**.
- Students can enter relevant course information, such as course name or code, to access a collection of uploaded papers.
- Users can contribute papers to the app. These contributions will be verified by an admin and, upon verification, made available to all users.

#### Self-Attendance Tracker:
- Students can track their attendance, percentage, and remaining leaves for each course.
- Users can manually log their attendance (present/absent) and maintain an easy-to-view record of their progress.
